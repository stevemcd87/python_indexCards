# python_indexCards
An app to help memorize commands and methods


- Utilizes RESTful api
- User chooses a language and subTopic
- App shows a list of index cards belonging to users past request.
- User is allowed to click on card which will show opposite side of card.

## Future

- Working on a review and test template
- Review will allow the user to see all cards for that language and review them freely.
- Test will display each cards back(description) side one at a time and allow
  the user to input what they think the command/ method is. 
- Test will allow the user to skip card or just reveal answer if they get stuck 
- I also want to scrape W3Schools to fill update my database instead of hard coding the data with admin
